This assignment is meant to introduce you to an operating system simulator
named NachOS (Not another completely heuristic operating system). We will
start with a basic implementation of NachOS that implements processes as
user-level light-weight threads and very limited system call support, just
enough to be able to run user programs and print outputs to stdout. 
In this assignment, we will improve the simulator by implementing twelve
new system calls, some of which are easy and some require a good understanding 
of NachOS. The simulator is written in C++. If you do not know C++, there is
a directory in the NachOS distribution with several C++ examples.

I will first give you an overview of the NachOS simulator. You should go
through the NachOS draft available on the course web site. The simulator
models a MIPS processor and as a result, can run only MIPS user programs.
However, you do not have to write test programs in MIPS assembly language. You
can write traditional C programs with only constraint that you cannot use any
C library functions. But this still allows a large variety of programs. On
top of this, we will develop a system call library specific to NachOS
environment that you can use in your test programs. A MIPS cross-compiler
compiles your C program into MIPS assembly language, which the MIPS assembler
compiles into an object file. Finally, the MIPS linker will generate the
executable that runs on NachOS. When NachOS is invoked to run
a user program, it loads the executable in memory and starts the thread in
the current context i.e., it does not create a new process context. NachOS
has a simple first-come-first-serve thread scheduler, which carries out the
context switch operation. Before we discuss more details about the NachOS
simulator and the assignment, let us first install the simulator and try to
run a few test programs.

Download cs330assignment1.zip from the course web site.
Put it in your home directory and unpack it as follows.

> unzip cs330assignment1.zip

Now we are ready to use the cross-compiler for compiling the test programs.
Before doing that, let us examine the contents of the NachOS simulator.
Change directory to ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/

The c++example/ directory may be important to those who are new to C++. This
directory does not contain any NachOS code.

Change directory to ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/

You will find several subdirectories here. The ones that are important for
this assignment are machine (describes the basic MIPS processor simulator),
threads (the basic NachOS thread management system), userprog (interface
needed to run user programs), and test (contains ten user programs written
in C, some of which will be used in this assignment). Now we will compile
the user programs in the test directory. The cross-compiler works cleanly
only on csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in. The user programs in the test directory
should only be compiled on this machine.

Log on to csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in using ssh with your username and password.

> ssh username@csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in

Replace username in the above line by your username. Once you are on
csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in, change directory to 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/bin/ and type make.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/bin/
> make

Next, change directory to ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/ and type make.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/
> make

If everything goes fine, you should see ten executables named forkjoin,
matmult, shell, testyield, testexec, halt, printtest, sort, vectorsum, and
testregPA. Out of these, matmult, shell, and sort are not relevant to this
assignment. You should go through the C files and all of these programs are
fairly straightforward to understand.

Log out of csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in. Now we will compile the NachOS
simulator. You should compile and run this simulator from any one of the two
machines: csecourses1.cse.iitk.ac.in and csecourses2.cse.iitk.ac.in.
Please do not overload any of the machines. Run top before starting to run 
your simulation and if there are already too many NachOS jobs running, try 
another of these two machines. Each of the two machines can run sixteen NachOS 
jobs simultaneously. Let us log on to csecourses1.cse.iitk.ac.in and compile
NachOS. Follow these steps. We will only compile the parts that are relevant
to this assignment.

> ssh username@csecourses1.cse.iitk.ac.in
> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/
> make depend
> make
> cd ../userprog/
> make depend
> make

Ignore all warnings. Check that there is an executable named nachos created
in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/ and 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/. Now, we are ready to run some simulations.

First, we will test the basic thread scheduler of NachOS. Change directory to
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/. Open main.cc. Notice that in the 
main function, after calling Initialize(), the ThreadTest() function gets 
called if we compiled with THREADS on (which we did and you can verify this 
from Makefile). One of the interesting things that the Initialize() function 
does is to create a main thread and make that the currently running thread. 
You can take a look at the Initialize() function defined in system.cc. 
Coming back to the ThreadTest() function, which is defined in threadtest.cc, 
it simply creates a new thread object and makes this thread execute the 
SimpleThread() function by calling Fork(). Remember that the Fork() function 
is called by the main thread. This Fork() function (defined in thread.cc) is 
different from the traditional UNIX fork() call. This function requires that a 
thread be already created and it only allocates a stack in such a way that 
when this thread is scheduled, it will start executing the function passed as 
the first argument to Fork (in this case SimpleThread()). The second argument 
to Fork() is passed as the only argument to the SimpleThread() function (in this 
case an id). The Fork() function finally enqueues this new thread to the ready 
queue. Coming back to the SimpleThread() function (defined in threadtest.cc), 
we notice that this function executes a for loop and after each iteration, it 
calls Yield(). This call essentially makes the currently running thread 
voluntarily yield the CPU to the scheduler so that some other thread (if any) 
can run. In the ThreadTest() function, both the main thread and the newly 
created thread call SimpleThread() and therefore, we expect them to 
alternately execute one iteration at a time. You can find the source code of 
Yield() in thread.cc.

With this understanding, we are ready to run nachos. Run ./nachos from
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/ directory. See if you can understand the 
output. It also prints some simulation statistics at the end.

Now, we will run some user programs on the simulated OS. This is done from the
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/ directory. Change to this directory.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/

You will be spending most of your time running nachos from this directory in
this assignment. Recall that the user program executables are in the
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/ directory. To run a user program on NachOS 
from the ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/ directory do the following.

> ./nachos -x ../test/halt

This runs the user program halt.c. This program simply calls sys_Halt(), which
invokes the syscall_Halt system call. This system call simply halts the simulated
machine.

Try running the program printtest.

> ./nachos -x ../test/printtest

This program prints "hello world", but then crashes with an exception. This
exception is generated by an unimplemented system call, namely, exit(). If you
try to run any other program relevant to this assignment, they will all crash
with some exception due to an unimplemented system call. This brings us to
the crux of this assignment. Your task is to make all these programs run
correctly and terminate cleanly. In the following, I will first explain how
system calls are implemented in NachOS and then discuss how to proceed with
the assignment.

In syscall.h under the directory ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/, 
currently several system calls are defined. The system call names start with 
syscall_. The actual system calls are wrapped into function calls. Corresponding 
to each system call, there is a function definition in syscall.h. The user 
programs are supposed to call these functions. These functions are defined in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/start.s. This is written in MIPS assembly 
language and each function essentially contains three MIPS instructions. The 
first instruction sets up the system call number register ($2) with the syscall 
number (recall that in MIPS, register $0 always contains zero). The second 
instruction is the syscall and the third instruction is the return from the 
wrapper function (recall that in MIPS, $31 contains the return address from a 
function). All registers are named as $ followed by the register number. Now, 
it should be clear how a user program transfers control back to NachOS on a 
system call. This essentially happens when the syscall instruction executes. 
This is implemented in a big switch-case block in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/mipssim.cc. Search for OP_SYSCALL
in this file. You will find that this instruction calls the RaiseException()
function. This function is implemented in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.cc. It takes two arguments, 
namely, the exception type (for a system call, this is of type SyscallException) 
and whether this exception is due to a bad address. In this assignment, we will 
always pass zero for the second argument, unless any user program tries to 
access a memory location that does not belong to the thread running the 
program. All exception types are defined in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h in the enum ExceptionType. 
Coming back to the RaiseException function, we find that it switches the mode 
to SystemMode (same as kernel mode in NachOS) and calls the ExceptionHandler() 
function, which takes the exception type as an argument. This function handles 
the exception and once the function returns, the mode switches back to UserMode. 
This completes the execution of the syscall instruction. The ExceptionHandler() 
function is defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/exception.cc. 
This is where all the system calls are implemented. The first line of this 
function stores the system call number from register $2 into a local variable 
named type. You can ignore the next few lines and go straight to the if-elseif 
block. The first condition checks if this is a halt syscall. In that case, it 
calls Halt() on the interrupt object. This is defined in interrupt.cc, which 
simply prints simulation statistics, cleans up all allocated simulator memory, 
and terminates the simulation. Returning to the ExceptionHandler() function, 
the else if chain implements four flavors of print system calls, namely, 
PrintInt, PrintChar, PrintString, and PrintIntHex. Recall that the system call 
arguments are passed in registers $4, $5, $6, $7, which are same as the MIPS 
function argument registers. So, when we call the wrapper function with the 
system call arguments (e.g., the integer to print in the PrintInt syscall), 
they automatically appear in the correct argument registers. The implementations 
of the print system calls use the NachOS console object, which in these cases, 
is connected to stdin for reading and stdout for writing (you need not worry 
about the details of how this is done in this assignment). You can ignore the 
occasional calls to writeDone->P(). The rest of the code for print implementation 
should be easy to understand. Remember that this implementation is very specific 
to NachOS. In reality, there is no special system call for printing. The same 
system call that writes to a file is used for writing to the stdout, which is 
treated as a file residing on a character device, as discussed in the class. 
One important thing to notice is that at the end of each print system call, 
the program counter is advanced using the following lines.

       // Advance program counters.
       machine->WriteRegister(PrevPCReg, machine->ReadRegister(PCReg));
       machine->WriteRegister(PCReg, machine->ReadRegister(NextPCReg));
       machine->WriteRegister(NextPCReg, machine->ReadRegister(NextPCReg)+4);

It is important to do this at the end of every system call where you expect
the user program to continue execution after this. It is a responsibility of
the exception handler because certain exceptions may not actually want the
program counter to advance and instead, may want the user program to
re-execute the instruction that raised the exception. This is mostly true for
non-syscall exceptions. These are usually called restartable exceptions and we
will learn about these later. The ReadRegister and WriteRegister functions are
defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.cc. All special 
registers such as the program counter (PCReg), stack pointer (StackReg), 
last program counter (PrevPCReg), next program counter (NextPCReg), etc. are 
defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h. This file also 
defines the basic Machine class. Before we move on to the discussion of the
system calls that you have to implement, we need to understand how a user
program starts executing in NachOS.

The NachOS simulation starts at the main function of
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/main.cc. If we are running user programs 
it would call the StartProcess() function when nachos is invoked with the -x 
flag. The StartProcess() function is defined in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/progtest.cc. The StartProcess() function 
takes the executable name as an argument. It allocates an address space and loads 
the executable in memory. See the AddrSpace constructor in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/addrspace.cc. One important 
thing to notice in this constructor is that it allocates an object named 
pageTable. This is a table that maintains a mapping between the
addresses found in the executable (usually called virtual addresses) and the
simulated NachOS addresses (usually called the physical address). Currently, the
mapping is one-to-one. The whole address space is divided into smaller chunks
called pages of size 128 bytes and assumes a total of 32 physical pages
(defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h and 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/disk.h).
So, any program that exceeds the total capacity of 128*32 bytes i.e., 4096
bytes would crash with an exception. Now returning to the discussion of
the StartProcess() function, once the address space is allocated, it attaches
this space to the current thread. So it is clear that the user program runs
in the context of the main thread created during the initialization of NachOS.
Next, it initializes the registers and restores states, if any, and then calls
Run() on the machine object. The Run() function is defined in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/mipssim.cc. This function starts executing 
the user program in an infinite for loop until the program terminates through some
exception or system call. The user program always starts executing from the
__start label in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/start.s. This is where the 
main function of the user program gets called from through the instruction "jal main".
After main returns, the sys_Exit(0) call is made, which invokes the syscall_Exit
system call. So, even if your user program does not have a call to sys_Exit(), the
program will be forced to go through it for a clean termination.

As we have seen, currently NachOS implements only five system calls: one for 
halting the simulated machine and four others to implement different flavours 
of print to stdout. Your task is to implement the following twelve system
calls by augmenting the code in exception.cc, possibly with other necessary
changes in the other parts of the simulator. However, you should confine
yourself to the following three directories only: 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/, ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/, 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/. The system calls are discussed below.

syscall_GetReg: Returns the contents of the processor register, number of which is 
passed as argument. Any return value of a syscall must be placed in register $2.
The testregPA.c program provided to you prints out the current program counter in hex
as a test for syscall_GetReg. However, you also need to verify that the printed value is 
correct. You can generate a dis-assembly of ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/testregPA.coff 
by doing the following (works only on csecourses4.cse.iitk.ac.in).

> ~/cs330assignment1/mips-i386-xgcc/bin/mips-objdump -D ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/testregPA.coff | less

The first column is the value of the program counter.

syscall_GetPA: Returns the physical address corresponding to the virtual address
passed as argument. You have to catch three error conditions in this system call and return
-1 if an error has occurred; otherwise the system call should return the physical address 
corresponding to the virtual address passed as the argument. The conditions to be checked 
are as follows.

1. The virtual page number is not larger than the number of entries in the page table. 
The virtual page number is obtained by dividing the virtual address by the PageSize defined in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h.

2. The page table entry has the valid field set to true indicating that the entry holds a 
valid physical page number.

3. The obtained physical page number (physicalPage field of the page table entry) is not 
larger than the number of physical pages. The number of physical pages is defined as NumPhysPages in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h.

If any of these three fails, the system call should return -1.

You can take help from the Translate method defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/translate.cc to 
see how a virtual address is translated to a physical address. This method has many things that you should 
not include in your system call handler.

syscall_GetPID: Returns the id of the calling thread. While I have declared
the pid variable in the Thread class defined in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.h, your task is to assign a unique value to this
when a thread is created.

syscall_GetPPID: Returns the id of the parent of the calling thread. The
ppid variable has been declared in the Thread class defined in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.h. You have to assign the correct value to it at
the time of thread creation depending on who the creator is.

syscall_Time: Returns the total ticks at present (roughly represents the current
simulated time). The Statistics class in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/stats.h defines
the totalTicks variable. The value of this is the current total ticks. You
need to find out how to get access to this variable through an object of type
Statistics class. Such an object has already been created in the simulator.

syscall_Sleep: Puts the calling thread to sleep for the number of ticks passed as
argument. You may take help from the Thread::Sleep() method implemented in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc.

syscall_Yield: The calling thread voluntarily gives up the CPU to the scheduler so
that some other thread can now be scheduled. You can take help from the
Thread::Yield() method implemented in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc.

syscall_Fork: Create a new thread and duplicate the address space of the calling
thread. You have to create a new address space and copy the contents from
the creator's space. You may take help from the Thread::Fork() method implemented in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc. However, remember that the implemented method
is different from the syscall_Fork syscall. The syscall_Fork syscall should be such that
the execution in the child starts as if it has just returned from the
sys_Fork() call. Also, the child pid should be returned to the parent and the
child should get a zero return value. Recall that the syscall return values 
are placed in register $2. The parent and child threads will have different
return values for syscall_Fork. Make sure to set up the pageTable of the newly
created thread's address space correctly.

syscall_Join: This is almost same as the wait() call we have discussed in the
class. However the sys_Join() call takes the pid of the thread to be waited on,
as in UNIX waitpid().

syscall_Exec: This is same as the execv() call we have discussed in the class. In
the context of NachOS, you need to mimic what the StartProcess() function
does. Do not try to reuse or overwrite the existing address space.
Remember to set up the page table for the new address space properly.

syscall_Exit: This implements the sys_Exit() call by destroying the calling
thread. Note that every user program calls sys_Exit() through __start defined in
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/start.s unless the program is halted through some other
exception. The syscall_Exit call needs to remove the calling thread's context
from the simulator. Read the companion draft on NachOS to see how a thread is
to destroyed.

syscall_NumInstr: Returns the number of instructions executed so far by the calling
process.

The following user programs in the ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/test/ directory are 
specifically written to help you test the correctness of the implementation of
these twelve system calls.

forkjoin.c
printtest.c
testexec.c
testregPA.c
testyield.c
vectorsum.c

Once you implement all the twelve system calls, these programs should all
execute and terminate cleanly, as expected without any error. When you want to
test your implementation, do the following.

> cd ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/userprog/
> make
> ./nachos -x test-executable-name

Replace test-executable-name with the executable name of one of the
aforementioned six user programs.

HINTS
------

Regarding the implementation of syscall_Exec
---------------------------------------------

The system call handler for syscall_Exec should not advance the program counter, 
since the sys_Exec() call never returns and must start execution at the beginning 
of the passed executable.

Regarding the implementation of syscall_Fork
---------------------------------------------

You have to change the source code of NachOS at several places to implement 
syscall_Fork and make it work correctly. Once syscall_Fork is implemented, at least 
two user threads will execute on NachOS in a time-shared manner. So it is natural to 
expect that the printed characters on stdout from these two threads will get interleaved.

The syscall_Fork implementation should create a thread object, create a new address 
space, set up the page table of the new address space properly, copy the contents of 
the parent space into the new space (each thread object has a pointer to its
address space), and finally, prepare the context of the child in such a way that when 
it is scheduled, it will start executing from the next PC. The preparation of the child 
context involves several steps. Copy the register set of the parent (the current machine 
registers) into child's saved user context. You can use the SaveUserState() method of the
Thread class defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc for this purpose. 
Make sure to set the return register value in the child context to zero. Next, we need to 
allocate the stack for running the simulator thread which will simulate the child code segment. 
It is important to understand that every user thread is simulated by a NachOS kernel thread 
and this NachOS thread needs a stack (this is different from the simulated stack of the 
user program, for which the address space has already been allocated as discussed above). 
You can think of the NachOS thread as a kernel thread attached to one user thread. 
You should try to understand what the StackAllocate() method in the Thread class defined
in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc does. You will use this method to create 
the stack for every forked thread. However, you need to pass a function name to this method. 
This is the function the NachOS thread will execute when the child is scheduled later.
This function will contain anything that the kernel needs to set up before the child thread can 
run for the first time. To set up the contents of this function, we need to understand what the 
kernel does in a context switch. This is defined in the Run() method of the Scheduler class defined 
in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/scheduler.cc. The context switch happens when this
method calls _SWITCH(). Notice that when the currently running thread is switched out, it is 
actually executing NachOS kernel code in the Run() method of the Scheduler class. Every NachOS 
thread spends a part of its life simulating the user program thread and the remaining part in 
running NachOS kernel code whenever it needs to simulate a system call on behalf of the
user thread. This system call may lead to execution of other NachOS kernel codes such as scheduler 
code on this thread's context. Since at the time a thread is switched out it is executing in the 
_SWITCH() function, every scheduled thread would start execution right after _SWITCH() when it is 
selected for running at a later point in time. This is, however, not true for a thread T that is 
scheduled for the first time. Before T is scheduled, the currently running thread will call
the Run() method of the Scheduler class (as usual), which will invoke _SWITCH(), as usual. However, 
after the _SWITCH() call returns, the new thread T will start running at the function that you 
passed as the first argument to StackAllocate(). Now, it should be clear that the function passed 
to StackAllocate() must carry out the things that the Run() method does after
_SWITCH() returns. You can see that after _SWITCH() returns, any threads needed to be destroyed are 
destroyed, and the registers and the address space of the scheduled thread are restored. This is 
what you need to do in the function that you pass to StackAllocate(). In addition to these, 
you should call the Run() method of the Machine class defined in 
~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/mipssim.cc. This method starts running the user thread in 
the context of the just scheduled NachOS thread. Coming back to the implementation of syscall_Fork,
after the StckAllocate(), the child thread is ready to be put in the ready queue. This is done through 
the ReadyToRun() method of the Scheduler class defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/scheduler.cc. 
Before calling this method, you have to turn off interrupt and turn it on back after the call. See how 
this method is used in other places. Finally, set the return register of the calling thread to the pid 
of the forked child.

Some suggestions on how to copy the address space of one process into the address space of another:

First, let me explain the distinction between the virtual
address space and the physical address space. The virtual addresses are
generated by the user program. The physical address space is the space of
the actual simulated memory of NachOS. Every virtual address must have a
corresponding physical address. The physical memory is simulated as a
character array named mainMemory in the Machine class. So, the physical
address of the byte mainMemory[i] is simply i. The page table of a process
address space remembers the mapping between virtual addresses and the
physical addresses. The way it is done is that both the virtual and physical
address spaces are divided into smaller chunks called pages. Each page is of
size 128 bytes (defined as PageSize). A virtual page maps to some physical
page. The current implementation of the page table maps the entire virtual
address space of a process onto a contiguous range of physical pages. For
example, a process with ten virtual pages (numbered 0 to 9) may have
physical pages 13 to 22. So the contents of the address space of this
process can be found in mainMemory[12*PageSize] to
mainMemory[22*PageSize-1]. A virtual address, say, 500 of this process maps
to mainMemory[12*PageSize+500]. Notice the the virtual address 500 of some
other process would map to some other location in the mainMemory array.

To copy the contents of the address space of process A into that of process
B, you first need to find out the starting index of the physical address
space of A in the mainMemory array. This can be done by multiplying the
first physical page number of process A by the PageSize. Let's call it S.
Next, we need to know the span of the address space of process A. This is
essentially the number of pages of process A multiplied by the PageSize. Let
this range be R. Similarly, let the starting index for process B be S'. Then
we need to copy from mainMemory[S+i] to mainMemory[S'+i] as i ranges from 0
to R-1.

Regarding the implementation of syscall_Join
---------------------------------------------

We will allow a thread to only join with one of its children. So, in the implementation 
of syscall_Join, it is necessary to check if the passed pid belongs to one of the children 
of the calling thread. If not, syscall_Join should just return -1. If the passed pid belongs 
to a legitimate child of the caller, the implementation checks if the child has already 
called sys_Exit(), in which case, it just returns the exit code of the child. If the child 
has not yet called sys_Exit(), the parent should call the Sleep() method of the Thread class 
defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc. Make sure to turn off interrupt 
before calling Sleep() and turn it on back after the thread returns from Sleep(). See how 
this method is used elsewhere in NachOS. It is now responsibility of the child to wake up the 
sleeping parent when the child calls sys_Exit(). Make sure to return the exit code of the 
child to the user program as the return value of syscall_Join. Keep in mind that after a thread 
calls sys_Exit(), all its data structures may get destroyed when the next thread is scheduled. 
So do not rely on any information stored in the thread object of an already exited thread.

Regarding the implementation of syscall_Sleep
---------------------------------------------

If the passed argument is zero, you should simply call Yield() of the Thread class and do not 
go to sleep. If the passed argument is non-zero, you need to put the caller to sleep for the 
specified number of totalTicks. However, we need a hardware timer that can wake up the calling
thread at the proper time. The following lines in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/system.cc 
instantiate a hardware timer that generates a timer interrupt every TimerTicks (defined in stats.h).

//if (randomYield)                          // start the timer (if needed)
       timer = new Timer(TimerInterruptHandler, 0, randomYield);

When such an interrupt is raised, the TimerInterruptHandler function is called. This function is 
defined in  ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/system.cc. Currently, it simply makes the 
calling thread yield the CPU, which effectively simulates a context switch due to quantum expiry, where
the quantum is TimerTicks. Keep in mind that the timer interrupt may not get generated exactly at 
every TimerTicks time, but may drift a little. To implement syscall_Sleep, you should maintain a 
global list of threads sleeping on a timer event. Keep the queue sorted by wakeup
time. Every time the TimerInterruptHandler function is invoked, it should check if it needs to 
wake up one or more waiting threads from this list. Since the timer interrupt is not generated 
every tick, a thread may overshoot its wakeup time, but this is the best we can do. So, the wakeup 
condition should check whether the wakeup time of a thread is less than or equal to the current 
totalTicks. If a thread needs to be woken up, it should be moved to the ready queue by calling the 
ReadyToRun() method of the Scheduler class defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/scheduler.cc. 
Before calling this method, you have to turn off interrupt and turn it on back after the call.
See how this method is used in other places. To put a thread to sleep, use the Sleep() method of the 
Thread class defined in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/threads/thread.cc. Make sure to turn off interrupt 
before calling Sleep() and turn it on back after the thread returns from Sleep(). See how this method 
is used elsewhere in NachOS.

Amount of simulated physical memory
------------------------------------

The simulated physical memory size is defined as NumPhysPages * PageSize. The constant 
NumPhysPages is defined as 32 in ~/cs330assignment1/nachos/code/machine/machine.h. None 
of the seven test programs provided to you for testing your implementations will require 
more pages than this. If you want to run more complicated programs for a more rigorous 
test (e.g., sys_Exec in a forked child, or nested fork, or forks in a loop, etc.), you may 
have to increase the amount of simulated memory. In such situations, increase NumPhysPages 
to a higher power of two such as 64 or 128.
